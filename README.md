## My Website

### Summary

Basically my website. Nothing so special about it.

- Made from Next.js, fully PWA compliant.
- Using stripped down customized MDBootstrap.
- Not gore.

### Using as Template

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irvanmalik48/blog blog
```

2. Modify template using your beloved text-editor.

   > Clue: everything is in the `components` folder.

3. Start blogging. (and don't forget to delete my markdowns, or no)

Run `npm run dev` to preview the site.

### TODO List

- [ ] Add AMP support.
- [ ] Add Telegram Instant View support.
- [ ] Add search bar for posts. (MIGHT CHANGE)
- [ ] Dynamically generate sitemap.
- [ ] Add projects section.
