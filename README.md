# My Website

Basically my website. Nothing so special about it.

## Features

- Made from Next.js, fully PWA compliant.
- Using TailwindCSS.
- Dark/Light mode switch.
- Small bundle sizes (50KB-ish).
- Automatically generated metadata images, sitemap, and RSS feed.

## Using as Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irvanmalik48/blog blog
```

2. Modify template using your beloved text-editor.

   > Clue: everything is in the `components` folder.

3. Start blogging. (and don't forget to delete my markdowns, or no)

Run `npm run dev` to preview the site.
