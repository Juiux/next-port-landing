# Abstract
Seems like blogging been a nice activity since past, eh? This blog actually has changed and hopped from over 69420 frameworks before I decide to just use Next.js with Jekyll-inspired stuffs. It turns out well above my expectations tho and the blog went smooth and fluid.  

# About Me
My name's Irvan Malik Azantha. I'm currently studying on Universitas Sriwijaya (English: University of Sriwijaya). I live in Palembang, Indonesia (very nice city, you should check it out). And yeah, that's it (LMAO what do you expect?).

# About This Blog
This blog is using Next.js framework as its base. If you want to copy the template or something just `git clone https://github.com/irvanmalik48/irvanmalik48.github.io`, modify stuffs here and there, deploy, and you will most likely good to go.  
Few summaries about Next.js:  
1. Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.  
2. Next.js is licensed under MIT License.  
For CSS stylings, I use MDBootstrap. It's Bootstrap but with Material Design applied. Cool right? Grab them at [their official website](https://mdbootstrap.com/) and for more informations and documentations.
