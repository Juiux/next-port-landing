## <p class="text-center">Introduction</p>

**Lappy.js** is a Next.js-based Jekyll-inspired static site generator framework made for casual blogging. This framework is actively developed and maintained by me ([@irvanmalik48](https://github.com/irvanmalik48)) as another side project in Github. It currently supports pretty much basic blogging with markdown and manual layout styling. This framework by itself is more of a barebone and/or template rather than actual featureful static site generators such as Jekyll, Hexo, etc.  
You can contribute to the project by forking it and then adding more features and optimizations. Don't forget to make pull requests after you done to make sure the project stays alive.

## <p class="text-center">Features</p>

1. Lightweight: Lappy.js is so lightweight and only needs few dependencies to build.
2. Extensive: Due to its Next.js nature, Lappy.js is so extensive and flexible.
3. DIY: Yes. We are really embracing this feature here. Design your own looks and feels. Freedom is in your hands.
4. Barebones: You can use this as a template for your own implementations. I wouldn't ask tho.
5. Simplicity: We thrive to keep this project as simple as we can and we encourage you to do so.

## <p class="text-center">Quick Start</p>

Lappy.js is currently still in development (it doesn't even have its own npm module yet smh). But if you insists on contributing and/or interested in it, you can clone the repository and edit stuffs here and there as you like. Don't forget to do some pull requests to further develop this framework.
