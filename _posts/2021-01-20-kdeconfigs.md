## Prologue

One day, I was sitting staring at my laptop. And yeah, it's Windows inside. It looks so boring with all those same things every year and just plain boring like hell.
So I decided, maybe installing some Windows skinpack would be good. Well, it turned out bad. I reverted everything back to default and simply carry away until few months ago, I found Linux.\

In Linux, there's this thing called Desktop Environment or simply DE. Wikipedia says:
> In computing, a desktop environment (DE) is an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer operating system that share a common graphical user interface (GUI), sometimes described as a graphical shell. The desktop environment was seen mostly on personal computers until the rise of mobile computing. Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system. Instead, the traditional command-line interface (CLI) is still used when full control over the operating system is required.

> A desktop environment typically consists of icons, windows, toolbars, folders, wallpapers and desktop widgets (see Elements of graphical user interfaces and WIMP). A GUI might also provide drag and drop functionality and other features that make the desktop metaphor more complete. A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world, such as buttons and windows.

> While the term desktop environment originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to describe the programs that realize the metaphor itself. This usage has been popularized by projects such as the Common Desktop Environment, K Desktop Environment, and GNOME.

So that's it for the wrap-up. As most of you are probably a Linux hobbyists already, yes, I'm a KDE user (hence the title). I know some Linux users feel some distaste for certain DEs with big memory consumption but KDE is worth its name. It has a wide array of customizations here and there to be discovered and the limit is really your imagination.
