## A Simple Story

A few days ago, I was curious if whether it will be fun to make a site in which I could do some blog stuffs.
So I made a site to host my blog posts and now here we are.
This site is powered by Jekyll and hosted on Github.

## About Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
