# Abstract

> _I just have to kill my own self again, and again, and again, until finally, I can seek freedom. A freedom where my pain is relieved and my sin is forgiven._

My past was and is still a dark one to see, let alone feel. The tragedies, the chaos, the destruction, they all exist in that same memories of pain and hatred, complete with vengeance and wrath. Hell marched upon my veins, corrupting them, succumbing me into the darkness. Blinded by fear and entangled in chains, I suffered trough horrid nightmares of killing my own self. Life was the worst thing I ever experienced... until now.

# To Forget a Legacy

## Where it all starts
I was a kind person back then. I was enthusiastic and optimistic, and often greedy in terms of knowledge. I would like to help people whenever they need for whatever they want. Jack of all trades, I would say. As the time goes, I started developing trust issues regarding on how often I've been manipulated by anyone because of my tendency to help others. My mind started to get more twisted and deranged the more the clock ticks. This is also because the side-effects of me becoming a social stigma and being bullied at the same time. People only cared about their problems being solved rather than me as one whom they asked help to. Even worse, they talked _shit tons of fucked off lies behind my back_ if they don't get what they want. This disgusts me and put myself in a more violent state of mind. Later on, an incident happened in which I have no idea on what's going on. It revolves around me and indirectly affects me, badly. I can't tell the details on how, what, why, when, who, and where it happened but it gave me a massive worsening shift in my already worsely violent state of mind. I started to become what previously disgusts me, treating myself with the feelings of _schadenfreude_, the malicious joy.

> _“Rumours should be juicy and gossips must be mouth-watering, since they have to uplift and make people feel better. Tittle-tattle can have a swift ripple effect and when the ball is rolling very fast, it kick-starts a flood of moral destruction. “Schadenfreude” can, then, be fully enjoyed.”_
- Erik Pevernagie

People loved seeing me suffer. They loved seeing me getting beaten out. They loved it when I fall. The pain and sufferings crossed by and fills my mind in the form of hate and urges for revenge. I started to manipulate people to do my own biddings, just as they did to me and my foolishness. I started to use them as my own set of dolls in which I can throw and replace if there's one "broken". Life was "fun" back then. I loved seeing them suffer. I loved seeing them getting beaten out. I loved it when they fall. The situation was flipped into my side. The power was all mine to bare.

> _“We are all the judges and the judged, victims of the casual malice and fantasy of others, and ready sources of fantasy and malice in our turn. And if we are sometimes accused of sins of which we are innocent, are there not also other sins of which we are guilty and of which the world knows nothing?”_
- Iris Murdoch

## Where it all ends
It's all evil and darkness until I met someone who enlightened me. She's the only person I can't actually control like anyone else. She insisted on giving me the hope that I had lost before the incident. She actually tried to fix my already-dead mind. I was trapped in a dilemma of my kind self and my demon. Fear of the side-effects on what I've done started to haunt me. Slowly but surely, I started to think on a different point of view. I started thinking that life is actually not that bad. I started to learn all my sins, despising it greatly. I started to see the light which I left before. It was not that bad.

> _“It is unwise, and potentially dangerous, to enjoy the misfortunes of others.”_
- Wayne Gerard Trotman

## Where it goes to
I now see the world and life in general with a more positive view. I retain back my old self and somehow still keep my demon just in case something goes south. She, the ones that gave me hope, now is the person whom I love and care the most. I stopped manipulating people for my own self and started to become more mature and self-sustaining. In other side, I learn that people actually are different each other and is a mistake to generalize it. I took another chance for my salvation and now keep moving to the future.

- Be a good person, not a too good person.
