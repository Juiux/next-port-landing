# Abstract

Seems like blogging been a nice activity since past, eh? This blog actually has changed and hopped from over 69420 frameworks before I decide to just use Next.js with Jekyll-inspired stuffs. It turns out well above my expectations tho and the blog went smooth and fluid.

# About Me

My name's Irvan Malik Azantha. I'm currently studying on Universitas Sriwijaya (English: University of Sriwijaya). I live in Palembang, Indonesia. I'm a highly enthusiastic person with subtle interest in open source projects and keen on learning new things. Also likes to watch anime, play games, and have hugs and cuddles (lmao).

# About This Blog

This blog is using Next.js framework as its base. If you want to copy the template or something just `git clone https://github.com/irvanmalik48/blog`, modify stuffs here and there, deploy, and you will most likely good to start.  
Few summaries about Next.js:

1. Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.
2. Next.js is licensed under MIT License.
