# Abstract

Well, who doesn't like music? I do, you do, everyone else do. You can't tell that I'm wrong lmao, it's just general truth that everyone likes music (or some form of it for some reason). The thing is, I _really really really_ like music I devoted to make some myself since I'm sometimes bored hearing stuffs made from everyone. If everyone can make it, so do I, and so be it. Without further shittalks, here's my take:

# no title

Well, pardon me for the name since I don't know what to name it, really. This song incorporates chill vibes and catchy tones. This song is about me (yes, me, you see it) and my current state of mind.

## Lyrics

```
Lost all hope on myself
I just can't keep it intact
Try to doom myself down
Oh, I feel so mad

Give me some time to realize
Things that made me bad
Damn I wonder when
All of you come back

Coffee on the countryside
Whatever makes me feel alright
I told myself to emphasize
There's nothing left to fantasize
I feel like I'ma blow up and
I feel like I'ma grow up then
I smile and try to simplify
That moment when we first say "Hi!"
Bumping to that empty chair
Reminiscing the interfere
When you all keep me out of there
Reminding all the smokes we share
I wish that you won't leave me there
I wish that you all asking where
I wish that I just can go tell
I wish that I just can go tell

Lost all hope on myself
I just can't keep it intact
Try to doom myself down
Oh, I feel so mad

Give me some time to realize
Things that made me bad
Damn I wonder when
All of you come back

Cause I'm lonely
Oh, I'm lonely
(vocal solo)
Cause I'm lonely
Oh, I'm lonely
(vocal solo)

ost all hope on myself
I just can't keep it intact
Try to doom myself down
Oh, I feel so mad

Give me some time to realize
Things that made me bad
Damn I wonder when
All of you come back
```
